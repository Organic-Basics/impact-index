# Organic Basics Impact Index

## What is this?

This repository contains the data used to calculate the Impact Index values for Organic Basics' products.

The data is divided by material and can be found in the `data` folder. 

Each set of material data contains data on various types of materials, such as both conventional cotton and organic cotton. The data is divided into separate supply chain elements.

The data for the organic and recycled materials is customized to Organic Basics' unique supply chain. It cannot reliably be used directly to calculate other brand's products. 

For more information on the Impact Index, the sources used to calculate it as well as the methodology, visit [the dedicated page on our website](https://organicbasics.com/pages/impact-index).

## Purpose

As part of Organic Basics' ongoing open-source efforts, we have decided to make the data behind the Impact Index publicly available.

In its current state, the data is customized to fit Organic Basics' own supply chain, but some ideas for future work include: 
1. Refining the emissions calculations by following the GHG protocol
2. Building the methodology into a tool that can be used to easily calculate the impact of other brand's products
3. Adding other materials, such as hemp, to the data
4. Finding a good way of calculating the impact related to the use phase of a product
